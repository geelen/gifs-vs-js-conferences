Qualification/joke
- I should write a joke

Story time
- Why me? I'm not a library author. I don't work for Google or Mozilla, trying to bring Web Components to life. I'm simply a user, like a lot of people in the room, and so I wanted to share some of the things I've learned along the way.
- A couple of years ago, me and some friends started an interesting project...
- VastImg
  - Fullscreen GIFs
  - Random one every time you refresh
  - Hours of fun
  - There was a problem
  - Anyone could add any URL to a GIF, with no moderation
  - We should all be ashamed of ourselves. We took something beautiful, and we 4channed it.
- GifCity
  - We built a fullscreen GIF slideshow from Tumblrs
  - Grab a tumblr (here are some cool ones), it will scrape all the GIFs and start playing them back
  - Days/weeks of fun.
- DJGif
  - About 10 months later, I wanted to do something more ambitious.
  - Noticed GIFs syncing to music were pretty cool
  - Started working on the idea, here's a quick demo (show 2 or 3 GIFs synced to the beat)
- X-Gif
  - Realised the biggest challenge was to speed up/slow down GIFs arbitrarily


- What's in X-GIF? (part 1)
  - How a GIF works
  - What it take to play it back at a normal speed. Half speed?

How to release it?
- Polymer! I can define a new image tag!

How do I use it?
- It's most useful when it can be interacted with
- How do I make a slider that changes the speed of the GIF?
- How can other people drop it in to their projects? What if they use Ember/React/Angular?




Thoughts to convey:

- Dreamcode! Write the most beautiful API you can think of. Use attributes, it's literally what they're for
- Know what type of component you're writing. There's a huge difference between a core piece of application logic you want to encapsulate and reuse & something to be used by others
- (true) Web Components are the
